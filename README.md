# Valentine's Day Proposal

This project is a playful and interactive web page designed to ask a special someone out on Valentine's Day. It features a question posed to the user with "Yes" and "No" response buttons. Clicking "No" causes the button to move to a random location on the screen, while "Yes" triggers a confetti celebration and displays a heartfelt message.

## Features

- **Dynamic Interaction**: Users can respond to the Valentine's Day proposal with "Yes" or "No" buttons.
- **Playful Button Behavior**: The "No" button moves randomly across the screen upon each click, encouraging the user to click "Yes".
